Crypto succeeds when it's a more productive implementation of it's competition. BTC/Gold are both financial religions. BTC is easy to trade/store/create with no delivery issues. BTC also enables transfer of value locally and globally . Gold is a hassle. Just look at Ft Knox Just finished a live session on Bloomberg Europe. And we are talking BTC, ETH, BNB, Alts non stop. Also talked about NFTs, Digital Yuan, and why companies don't go public (including Bloomberg😆). Thanks for having me. Always a courteous retweet.🙏
